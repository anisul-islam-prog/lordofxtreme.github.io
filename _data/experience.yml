    ## I was in charge of development and maintenance of myshipment.com. I built REST and SOAP APIs to fetch data from third-party services and the view using <mark>Javascript</mark>, <mark>CSS</mark> and <mark>HTML5</mark> to show data in MAP. As there are multiple services I had to built both <mark>GET</mark> and <mark>POST</mark> endpoints for many <mark>APIs</mark>.
